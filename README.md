# SauceDemo QA Portfolio Project

This is a QA portfolio project built using [SauceDemo.com](https://www.saucedemo.com/) to demonstrate a full end-to-end Quality Assurance process — from test planning and manual testing to bug reporting and (eventually) automation.

## 🧪 Project Objective

To showcase manual QA skills with real deliverables, structured testing methodology, and clear documentation, in preparation for transitioning to automation using Selenium WebDriver and TestNG.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

- Google Docs / Sheets (Test Plan, Test Cases)
- Windows OS
- Git & GitHub
- Java (planned for automation)
- Selenium WebDriver (planned)
- Eclipse (planned)
- TestNG (planned)
